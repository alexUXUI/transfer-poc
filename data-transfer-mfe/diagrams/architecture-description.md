Browser-Based Data Transfer System Architecture
Context
Modern web applications often need to transfer large datasets between different systems. Traditional approaches rely on server-side processing, which consumes server resources and creates bottlenecks. A browser-based solution leverages client computing power and provides a more scalable and resilient approach.
Problem Statement
Transferring large volumes of data between systems presents several challenges:
Server resource limitations for processing large datasets
Network interruptions causing complete transfer failures
Limited visibility into transfer progress
Data consistency issues when transfers are interrupted
General Solution Approach
The architecture utilizes the web browser as an intelligent intermediary between source and target systems. By leveraging modern browser capabilities like IndexedDB for persistence and the Fetch API for communication, the solution creates a robust data pipeline with built-in resilience.
How It Works
Session Initialization: A transfer session is created and stored in IndexedDB with metadata about the source, target, and transfer parameters.
Chunked Data Processing:
Data is fetched from the source in manageable chunks
Each chunk is temporarily stored in IndexedDB with a "pending" status
Chunks are processed in parallel (with concurrency limits)
After successful processing, chunk status updates to "completed"
Resilient State Management:
All operations are persisted to IndexedDB
A state machine governs both session and chunk lifecycles
Pause/resume functionality allows transfers to be interrupted safely
Failed chunks are automatically retried up to a configurable limit
Event-Driven Architecture:
The system operates on an event-driven model rather than polling
Components communicate through well-defined events
UI receives real-time progress updates
Why This Approach
IndexedDB Support: IndexedDB has broad browser support and allows for persistent storage of significant amounts of structured data.
Resume Capability: The stateful approach means transfers can be paused/resumed even if a user closes the browser and returns later.
Lightweight Implementation: This solution doesn't require heavy frameworks or complex infrastructure.
Network Resilience: Automatic retry logic handles transient network failures.
Parallelism: Concurrent chunk processing improves throughput while maintaining control.
Client-Side Processing: Offloads work from servers to client browsers, distributing computational load.
Background Processing Options
While the current implementation focuses on foreground processing, the architecture can be extended to support background processing through:
Background Sync API
Allows data synchronization to continue when the user navigates away from the page
Can be configured to retry failed network requests when connectivity is restored
Provides a cleaner user experience by removing the need to keep the transfer page open
Service Workers
Enables fully offline-capable transfers that continue even when the browser is closed
Can intercept network requests to implement advanced caching strategies
Supports periodic background sync for regular data transfers
Allows for push notifications to alert users when transfers complete
Conclusion
The browser-based data transfer architecture provides a viable, efficient solution for moving large datasets between systems. By leveraging modern browser capabilities, it achieves resilience, performance, and user experience benefits that traditional server-based approaches cannot match.
This architecture can be implemented with varying levels of sophistication depending on requirements:
Basic implementation using just IndexedDB and Fetch API
Enhanced version with Background Sync for improved user experience
Full-featured solution with Service Workers for true background processing
The modular, event-driven design makes it adaptable to different use cases while maintaining core benefits of resilience and performance.
