Ok, now we will begin the endeavor to prove something. Our entrie goal is to the browser client to transfer the data exposed in @express-server to the @experss-reciever using the @data-transfer-mfe. The whole purpose of this is to show that we can use the browser to transfer the data. The browser transfer MUST handle the inflight data. THe browser MUST be able to start and stop the data transfer if the user: closes the browser, updates the url, refreshes the page. It sohuld handle this situations gracefully and show an alert if the user has data in flight. The solution must also be supported by Firefox and Safari, so we cannot use the Background Task API unfortunately. If the operation fails, we need to see the ouput. There should be a button in saying "start transfer", this should start downloading the objects by 100 and then putting them in a queue for processing and uploading them to the POST endpoint, 100 at a time. Theere should be UI indicating the operation is going and if possible the overall progress, even if the full count of the records is not known, which it will not be in production runtime. The MFE that is responsible for starting the operation should continue the operation even if the MFE isn't mounted to the DOM, say for example, the user is stillin the same SPA, but the data transfer MFE is not mounted. Before producing any code, lets talka bout our options and best ideas for a solution in natural language before we proceed furhter. Let me know what I am missing, what your concerns are, and how you would imporve the overall design to be extremely robust and reduce risk and recover in cases where something happens to interrrupt the transfer.
