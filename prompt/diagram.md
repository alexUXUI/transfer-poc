Let's put on our architecture hat and produce a UML sequence diagram of the system we have built, which is a system for data transfer between two servers, using the web browser and its powerful APIs. Lets create an extremely detailed diagram using mermaid UML syntax. it should have the two servers, the browser and the specific browser APIs as actors, we really want to focus on the browser and how it leveraes browser APIs to accomplish this. It is the single most important part of the design. We need to explain to technology experts how the browser enables this ability to tansfer data. We need to really dive into indexDB as well. We need to document the tables, and the state, and the state machine that process the chunks. This logic should be clearly documented and diagramed.
